# PixelBlaster Pico V5 and  PixelBlaster Pico V5 PD 

The PixelBlaster Pico V5 is the same great board as the PixelBlaster Pico, but in a smaller super compact form factor of 12 mm x 28 mm, making it the world’s smallest WLED controller.  It is a next-generation, feature-rich WLED controller with bypass power and optional USB Power Delivery 3.1 capabilities for any 5 volt addressable lighting project you may have. If you need a WLED controller that is super small to fit right in a LED channel, tight locations or battery applications, this is the controller for you. 

But you can’t stop there, because it is low-cost and uses the workhorse ESP32, it can be used in any application where power injection is used. If you want to power it from a USB-C Power Delivery supply, that integrated option is available in a stacked 12 mm x 42 mm package. 

It supports virtually all LED strips and serial matrices using single-wire protocols, such as the WS2811 and WS2812B, to SPI (clocked-data) protocol devices, such as the WS2813 and SK9822, 5 volt only. 

## Features (controller) 

- Uses the workhorse ESP32 dual-core 240MHz processor. 
- Two channels of 5-volt logic-level translated outputs using ultra-fast and high-current LVC technology with matched and modeled serial inline resistors for high quality signal drive over short or long cables. 
- Low-profile Wago push-button terminal block for easy and secure electrical connections. 
- Compact form factor of 12 mm x 28 mm fit right in a LED mounting channel. 
- High-quality 4-layer impedance-controlled PCB with gold-plated connectors (ENIG) for durability and corrosion resistance. 
- LMD2718T261 PDM 24-bit digital microphone with a sensitivity of -26 dB FS and SNR of 57 dBa. 
- Controller input power: 5 volts 
- Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection on all inputs. 
- Supports ESP-NOW based remote controls. 
- Easy flashing of custom firmware through onboard header or via USB-C with PD option. 
- Pads exposing three ESP32 GPIOs for custom functions. 
- Power and signal pads exposed for hardwired solder options. 
- Comes with a tiny custom 3D-printed PLA+ case (design files available upon request). 
- Comes pre-flashed with the latest version of WLED. 


 ## Features (PD option) 

- Onboard ATtiny1616 controller manages the AP33772S Power Delivery 3.1 sink controller. 
- Input power: 5 volts @ 5-amp max. via USB-C connector, up to 25 watts max. 
- Overvoltage and undervoltage protection on input power that shuts off power to LEDs and the board. 
- Overcurrent protection with 5-amp “electronic” fuse. 
- Over temperature protection of the board and moisture detection on USB-C connector. 
- Onboard 34-amp AlphaSGT MOSFET "relay" that reduces current draw to just 80mA @ 5V when LEDs are turned off. 
- Onboard LED reports Power Delivery negotiation results. 
- Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection on all inputs.  

## USB Power Charger/Supply Selection 

Key to using any USB charger or supply is its selection by way of the voltages and current it supports.  We suggest using a USB Power Delivery 3.1 certified supply, but it goes deeper than that. 

Standard USB BC 1.2 (Type-A and Type-C connectors) provides 5 volts at a rated current, the maximum of 1.5 amps, but sometimes your do see charge rate to 2 amps. 

Standard USB Type-C 1.2 provides 5 volts at a rated current, the maximum current is typically 3 amps. 

USB Type-C Power Delivery 3.0 added negotiation of voltage and current profiles (PDOs), called SPRs, between the source and sink with a maximum fixed voltage at 20 volts and 5 amps.  The standard also offers a programmable power supply (PPS) profile that from 3.3v to 21 volts, and up to 5 amps maximum current. 

USB Type-C Power Delivery 3.1 adds greater fixed voltage profiles, called EPRs, to 48volts at 5 amps, and a second programmable voltage range (called AVS) from 15 volts to 28 volts at up to 5 amps maximum current 

The PixelBlaster PD boards negotiates with the charger to provide the greatest current available at the selected voltage, either 5 volts, 12 volts, or 24 volts.  Upon plugging into your charger or switching to the desired voltage dymically, the PixelBlaster PD boards enumerate through the profiles and finds the maximum current for a given voltage first using PPO and AVS profiles, then the fixed voltage profiles. 

In selecting your charger/supply, it needs to have a profile that fits the voltage and current you will be running your LED strips at. 

The following are a few models that work well for different strip voltages:

The AOHi Magcube works great for 5-volts and 12-volt strips giving a full 5 maps of current. The Anker is cost effective for 5-volt strips at 5 amps, but for 12-vot strips is limited to 3 amps.  The AMEGAT Power Bank is a great portable solution and although its literature and the back placard states it supports a PPO profile allowing 5 and 12-volts at 5amps, it does not. Unfortunately, at the time of writing there is only one charger that covers 5-volt, 12-volt, and 24-volt strips at a full 5 amps and that is the Framework 180watt USB-C Power Adaptor, but it is very pricey at over $100. 

Fortunately for our customers, EPS32andmore.com, in a few short weeks will make available a new and extremely capable power adaptor called the GaN PD3.2 240w. It has all the PD 3.1 fixed profiles from 5 volts to 48 volts at 5 amps, PPS: 5–21 volts at 5 amps, and AVS: 15–48 at 5 amps, making it the end all solution at a comfortable price of $39.99.

### USB Type-C Cables

The last component of any Power Delivery setup is a good quality PD3.1, 240 watt certified cable. Mnany fine cable are out there but we recommend the INIU USB C to USB C Cable, 240W Fast Charging Cable for its quality and fair price. 

### Programming WLED

- The PixelBlaster Nano PD comes pre-programmed from the factory with the lastest version of WLED.  To update WLED, simply follow the instructions [here](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/getting-started/) under Software Update Procedure, Method 2.
- To reflash over the USB interface simply go [here](https://install.wled.me/). (Note: after reflashing due to a driver issue, disconnect the board from your PC and connect to a power adaptor where you can then enter in your WiFI credentials via the AP.
